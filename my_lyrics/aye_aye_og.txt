Aye Aye OG
What they say like
Hop out the whip
Then bust out the glick like

I get the get chips with a dip
With the miss in a dish
Imma eat out the b*tch like

Pull out the whip
This ain't no makeshift
Hi-end sh*t imma flex it right

I ain't tryna bet with the kid that said
There is no trust imma make it right

Man don't test me
Pull out a glick when u wanna come test me
Rap so shady this is the wave list
This shits a weightless
Bars on me like the greatest

This is the basis
Like i'm in bases
Dropping the cases

Up in the places
Fuck all the faces
Leaving no traces
Party like aces

เธอสนใจทองและก็เพชร
กูไม่ชอบเพื่อนไม่ Connect
ส่งมึงเข้าไป Microwave
Money on me I protect

VVS all on my team
That b*tch like who what you mean
Take all yo shit like a lien
Money on me on a scene

How u got b*tches when u can't really say sum
Getting big money I be getting on a ransom
Litty like a titty I be drinking on sangsom
Take a lil pic coz a chiga looking handsome

Up in the booth I be going bezerk
Tippy toppy I be bopping like kirk
Bad b*tch on me when I give her a smirk
Stuck in my gangster way got me a burk

I'm from the trenches I came from the hood
I got me them baddies they rolling the woods
From nothing to something I know that I could
Never be stuntin' I know that I should

Swerving the street I be drifting the way
Got me no blinkers i'm passing the lane
Up to a million viewers a day
And all of this money man what can I say
B*tch

Got it along
These papers i'm countin' it's where it belong
My brothers be lifting we comin' in strong
I'm beggin' ya b*tch while she suckin that long

Wondering if she like therapy
Talk to a b*tch that be talkin' to Kennady
Give her the tip and she hitting the melody
Mixing that whip when i'm cooking that recipe
I be that sh*t what they talkin bout

Aye aye OG
what they say like
Hop out the whip
Then bust out the glick like

I get the get chips with a dip
With the miss in a dish
Imma eat out the bitch like

Pull out the whip
This ain't no makeshift
Hi-end shit imma flex it right

I ain't tryna bet with the kid that said
There is no trust imma make it right
